# Synchronization
 
Synchronization of two signals (actual speed and predicted speed).

As a user I would need my data streams aligned therefore I need a synchronization service that syncs my data streams.

Acceptance Criteria
1. Convert from 30 Hz to 10 Hz speed recordings from phone
2. Develop a synchronization model that aligns predicted speed and speed
recorded with iphone(converted to 10Hz in 1.)
